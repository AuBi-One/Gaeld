 * Removes an invoice's journal entry with its reversal when the invoice is deleted or purged.

 * The reversal is found by the reference LedgerService::reverseEntry gives it: "REV-" + the
 * reversed entry's own reference. For invoices finalised in Gäld that is the invoice number;
 * for entries written otherwise (e.g. imported invoices) it is not, and looking it up by the
 * number would delete the original and keep its reversal. A posted entry that was not reversed
 * is refused: deleting it would silently remove booked revenue.
